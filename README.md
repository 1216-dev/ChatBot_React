# ChatBot_React
This project is an interactive AI-driven chatbot UI built using React (Next.js) and integrates with an AI model backend (Flask with GPT-2 or another model). The chatbot allows users to have a conversational experience, with the ability to send messages, attach files, record voice messages, and rate bot responses.
